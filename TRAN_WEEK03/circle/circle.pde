//make variable
// when you make your own variables, you determine the name, the data type, and the value.
// the range of values that can be stored within a variable is defined by its data type. 
// the integer data type can store numbers without decimal places (whole numbers) 
// types of data types: integers, floating-point, (decimal) numbers, characters, words, images, fonts, and so on. 
// variables must first be declared, which sets 
//floating point values are more valuable because of the smoothness / precision 
// an integer requires less memory than a floating point
// boolean = true or false 
// strings that is another one that is basically a series of characters that stores names, sentences, and etc. instructions are written using strings
// and store it and move it around. they are useful when reading texts and etc and have text analyses. 
// at every space do neat data visualization with strings 
// int x;  // declare x as an int variable
//  x = 12; // assign a value to x
// int x = 12; // declare x as an int variable and assign a value
